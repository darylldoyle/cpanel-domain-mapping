# cpanel-domain-mapping

Add's cPanel integration to [WPMUDEV](http://wpmudev.org)'s [Domain Mapping](http://premium.wpmudev.org/project/domain-mapping/)

This will hook into the cPanel API and automatically park a domain that is mapped through Wordpress. It'll also unpark that domain if it's deleted.


## Installation

Upload to `wp-content/plugins/cpanel-domain-mapping/` then go to your network plugins panel and activate it!

You can then go to `Settings > Domain Mapping cPanel` and enter your cPanel settings so that the API can connect.

After that, you're good to go!
